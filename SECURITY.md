# Security Policy

Eule is an MCP server that an AI assistant drives on your behalf. It holds
mail, calendar, contact, file and document credentials, so the threat model
assumes **tool arguments are untrusted** — a model can be steered by
prompt-injection embedded in an email, document or calendar item it just read.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately via GitHub Security Advisories
(**Security → Report a vulnerability**) on this repository, or by email to the
maintainer, rather than opening a public issue. We aim to acknowledge reports
within a few days.

## Hardening in place

- **No mail header injection.** Recipient/subject header values are rejected or
  encoded if they contain CR/LF, so a crafted address or subject cannot smuggle
  a hidden `Bcc:` or extra headers (`src/utils/security.ts`, mail connectors).
- **No upstream injection.** EWS SOAP, Microsoft Graph OData `$filter`, Graph
  URL path segments, and iCalendar/vCard values are escaped/encoded before use.
- **Secrets at rest.** Connector passwords/API tokens, Google client secrets,
  TOTP seeds, and explicitly opted-in M365 passwords created through MCP or the
  CLI are stored in macOS Keychain,
  Windows Credential Manager, or Linux Secret Service; YAML retains only opaque,
  scoped references. Legacy inline secrets remain supported for migration.
  `~/.eule` is `0700`, while `config.yaml` and `tokens.json` are atomically
  written `0600`. OAuth access/refresh tokens remain permission-protected in
  `tokens.json`, not encrypted by the OS credential store.
- **TLS enforced for credentialed connectors.** CalDAV, CardDAV and Paperless
  URLs must be `https://` (loopback `http://` is allowed for local tools). SMTP
  uses `requireTLS` so a stripped-STARTTLS MITM cannot downgrade to cleartext.
- **Filesystem sandbox.** Downloads may only be written under
  `~/.eule/<subdir>`, `~/Downloads`, `~/Documents` or `~/Desktop`, never over a
  reserved file (`config.yaml`, `tokens.json`, `eule.db`). Local files chosen for
  upload may only be read from `~/Downloads`, `~/Documents` or `~/Desktop` —
  **never** `~/.eule` or arbitrary paths — so secrets cannot be exfiltrated to
  the cloud.
- **Resource limits.** Tool calls have deadlines, multi-provider reads have
  bounded concurrency, supported HTTP providers receive cancellation signals,
  and buffered remote responses are size-capped. Some third-party protocol
  libraries cannot force-cancel in-flight socket work; see
  `FINAL_SECURITY_REVIEW.md`.
- **Auth secrets bypass the model.** Access/refresh tokens and OAuth
  authorization codes are obtained through an interactive browser, CLI, or the
  native `eule-helper`, then written directly to `tokens.json`. MCP auth tools
  return only account, provider, tier, expiry, and health metadata. The helper's
  branded `secret-prompt` window writes entered values directly to the native
  credential store without exposing them to the model, stdout, argv, or logs.
- **Transactional secret changes.** Secret-bearing MCP schemas do not exist.
  Metadata is validated before prompting; revisioned credential swaps commit
  config before old-secret deletion and remove newly captured credentials on a
  failed/stale write. The native helper's stdout is isolated from MCP stdout,
  prompts are serialized, and cancellation terminates the helper process.
- **Tool policy and routing.** Work-context policies centrally enforce enabled,
  read-only, and connector-domain restrictions. Mutations are role/account
  scoped; these controls are not multi-human RBAC because stdio has one OS
  principal.
- **Auditable execution.** Tool failures include correlation IDs; structured
  lifecycle logs exclude arguments, bodies, tokens, and provider payloads.
- **Helper integrity.** Installed releases download `eule-helper` from this
  repository's matching GitHub release, verify its published SHA-256, and cache
  it `0700` before execution. Source checkouts may use their own Cargo build;
  operators may also set an absolute `EULE_HELPER_PATH`. Those two development
  paths are local trust decisions and deliberately bypass release checksums.
  Relative overrides are rejected. The released macOS build is a Developer-ID-
  signed, notarized universal binary (hardened runtime + secure timestamp).
- **M365 autofill is explicit opt-in and helper-local.** TypeScript passes only
  scoped OS-store references to `eule-helper`; the helper reads password/TOTP
  values directly into zeroizing memory. They never traverse Node, a temporary
  file, an environment variable, argv, stdout, logs, MCP, or model context.
  Password and generated-code injection are gated twice on the exact
  `https://login.microsoftonline.com` origin, and arbitrary password bytes are
  JSON-encoded before the one-time fill. OAuth redirects require an exact base
  URI, matching OAuth state, and PKCE. Stored password and TOTP each reduce the
  security gained from independent factors, so both are disabled until
  separately configured by the user in Eule's branded local prompt.
- **Auth debug artifacts** (DOM/screenshots of the login flow) are written only
  when `EULE_AUTH_DEBUG` is set, and then `0600`.

## Supported versions

This project is pre-1.0 and under active development; only the latest `main`
receives security fixes.
